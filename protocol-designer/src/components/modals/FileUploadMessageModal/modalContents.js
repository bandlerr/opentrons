        Your protocol will be automatically updated to the latest version.
        Please note that the updated file will be incompatible with older
        versions of the Protocol Designer. We recommend making a separate copy
        of the file that you just imported before continuing.

      <p>
        Updating the file may make changes to liquid handling actions. Please
        review your file in the Protocol Designer as well as with a water run on
        the robot.

        We have added new features since the last time this protocol was
        updated, but have not made any changes to existing protocol behavior.
        Because of this we do not expect any changes in how the robot will
        execute this protocol. To be safe we will still recommend keeping a
        separate copy of the file you just imported.

          To import your file successfully, you must update your protocol to use
          the new labware definitions.
        </strong>{' '}
        Your protocol was made using an older version of Protocol Designer.
        Since then, Protocol Designer has been improved to include new labware
        definitions which are more accurate and reliable.
      </p>

      <div className={styles.section_header}>
        What this means for your protocol
      </div>
      <p>
        Updating your protocol to use the new labware definitions will
        consequently require you to re-calibrate all labware in your protocol
        prior to running it on your robot. We recommend you try a dry run or one
        with water to ensure everything is working as expected.
      </p>

        {"What happens if you don't update"}
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          If you choose not to update, you will still be able to run your
          protocol as usual with older labware, however you will not be able to
          make further updates to this protocol using the Protocol Designer.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className={styles.note}>
        Please note that in order to run the updated protocol on your robot
        successfully, the OT-2 App and robot are required to be updated to
        version 3.10.0 or higher.
